## tekhedd/mixxx-vestax-vci-400 project license

This work is derived from the original mapping by Owen Williams and Tobias Rafreider. So,
it's licensed the same as Mixxx (GPLv2), and retains that license.

Contributions to this project by me (tekHedd) are licensed under the WTFPL 2. So you can do what
you like with them, including relicensing the code under GPLv2 and distributing it thusly.
